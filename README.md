**These are all the files for edge detection on the de10 nano FPGA**

1. The edge detection code is located in the C code folder. This folder contains compiled C and non-compiled C code + a READ ME txt file.
1. EDA Playground for edge detection with Verilog and Testbench
1. Images are in JPG and BMP format
1. Read the Linux on the FPGA first and the FPGA on Windows second, Edge Detection on the FPGA using SSH and VNC last. By following the tutorial sequentially, this will lead you to perform edge detection on an FPGA running Linux
